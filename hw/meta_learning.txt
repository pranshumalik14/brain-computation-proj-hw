A scientist moving to a new field carries meta-strategies for thinking conceptually, framing hypotheses and possibilities, designing experiments, and spotting anomalies, even without domain-specific facts. Computationally, this involves learning abstractions, hierarchies, and adaptive composition — selecting and recombining prior “knowledge modules”, and flexibly updating them, for instance when prediction errors arise. At its core, meta-learning requires recursive (or higher-order) knowledge and understanding, i.e., learning that (what) we have learnt.
